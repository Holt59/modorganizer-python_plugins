# Mod Organizer 2 - Python Plugins

This repository contains examples of python plugins for [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer).

## Available plugins

Each plugin is in its own folder, and you can install it by simply downloading [the archive](https://github.com/Holt59/modorganizer-python_plugins/archive/master.zip)
and extracting the corresponding folder to the `plugins/` folder of your MO2 installation.

:warning: &nbsp; These plugins are not meant to be used by normal MO2 users but are examples to get plugin
developers started.

:information_source: &nbsp; I tried to document each plugin as best as I could, so some plugins
might look overly commented. Some plugins requires to generate files using `PyQt5`, everything is
explained in the `README.md` in the folder.
