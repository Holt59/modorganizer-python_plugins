# MO2 Python Plugins - Hide Run Panel plugin

This plugin is a very small plugin that only implements the `IPlugin` interface. This
shows what can be done using only the callbacks from `IOrganizer`.

Even if this plugin is *controversial*, it was useful to someone one day, which is
why it stays here. The sole purpose of this plugin is to hide the run panel from MO2.
